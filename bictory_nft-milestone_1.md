# Milestone Delivery Template

> IMPORTANT - Only the GitHub account that submitted the application is allowed to submit milestones. 
> 
## Invoice
Every grantee must provide a proper invoice to the Concordium team via email. 

## Deliverables
* Deliverables must follow the [official milestone delivery guidelines. ](https://github.com/Concordium/Concordium-Free-Open-Grant-Milestone-Delivery)
*  Please share a list of all deliverables of the relevant milestone extracted from the initial application and a link to the deliverable itself. 
Ideally all links inside the below table should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository. 
Thus, if you plan on continuing work after delivery, we recommend that you create a separate branch for either the delivery or your continuing work. 
> 
> If there is anything particular about any of the deliverables we or a future reader should know, use the respective `Notes` column.
